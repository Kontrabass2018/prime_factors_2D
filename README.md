# What is the data?

The data is all the integers, from 1 to 1000 represented by a binary vector of their prime factors. The values are set to 1 when a the prime is one of the integer's prime factors.  It is set to 0 otherwise. Consequently, many squares are set to 0, and power integers have the exact same binary encoding.

The code necessary to generate this data can be found in the

All integers from 1 to 40,000 represented as binary vectors of their prime factors divisibility. The representation of the points is done with UMAP. Color of point represent the value (yellow is high, blue is mid, purple is low).

All integers from 1 to 80,000 represented as binary vectors of their prime factors divisibility. The representation of the points is done with UMAP. Color of point represent the value (yellow is high, blue is mid, purple is low).
